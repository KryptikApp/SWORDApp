A Solana address is a Base58-encoded string of a 256-bit ed25519 public key. Once initialized, the Kryptik seedloop automatically generates a valid Solana address with the provided seed.

### Get Solana Address

```typescript
const m: string =
  "brain surround have swap horror body response double fire dumb bring hazard";
const seedLoop: HDSeedLoop = new HDSeedLoop({ mnemonic: m });
const networkSol = NetworkFromTicker("sol");
const addresses = seedloop.getAddresses(networkSol);
// first address should be equal to: 4Ccc4fnp6KHtkY1YRf8Zc1QhESrwyY4gydiutFtmQ8Bh
```

### Add Solana Address

The Kryptik seedloop can generate multiple accounts for the same seed. Each account is represented by a unique address and signing key.

```typescript
const seedLoop: HDSeedLoop = new HDSeedLoop();
const networkSol = NetworkFromTicker("sol");
// generate four new solana addresses
const addresses = seedloop.addAddresses(networkSol, 4);
// there will now be five total Sol addresses on the seedloop (first was autogenerated)
```
