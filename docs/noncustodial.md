There are two primary types of wallets: custodial and noncustodial.

Custodial wallets like Coinbase, have full control over your assets. This requires trust and limits the actions you can take.
As a noncustodial wallet, Kryptik never touch your private keys. All actions that require your permission (like sending money or swapping coins) are done on your device. This setup gives you full ownership of your wallet and lets you connect to any application you like.
