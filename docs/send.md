With Kryptik, you can make a payment without going through a financial institution. This peer-to-peer setup makes payments fast and cheap. To make your first payment with Kryptik, follow the steps below.

1. Set the Amount

Decide how much you would like to send. The amount can be entered in dollars or the native token amount. A small network fee (required by the blockchain) will be added to the total amount.

2. Add a Recipient

Your payment needs to go to someone! If the recipient also has a Kryptik wallet, you can enter their email. Otherwise, you can enter their public [address](./addresses) or ENS name.

3. Approve

Make sure everything looks right and send! It may take up to ten minutes for your transaction to be confirmed.
