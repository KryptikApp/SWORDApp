Welcome to Kryptik! We're so glad you're here. This guide will help you create your first wallet.

1. Enter Your Email

Your email is used to help with authentication. Instead of reusing an old password, you can login with email verification. When combined with on device encryption, this helps keep your funds secure.

2. Verify Your Account

Kryptik will send a 'magic link' to your email. Click this link to confirm your email address. You will then be directed to your wallet.

3. Confirm Setup

Once confirmed, Kryptik will automatically create a wallet on your device. Your wallet status should say 'connected'.

And voila! In less than a minute, you have created a wallet.
