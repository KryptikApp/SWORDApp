Swaps allow you to trade one token for another. This is useful for payments and a wide variety of financial applications. With Kryptik, swaps are easier than ever: a single interface allows you to trade 100s of tokens across multiple networks. Just choose your tokens and Kryptik will find the best price on a wide range of decentralized exchanges. You can even swap tokens from one blockchain to another! The steps below will help you get started. Happy swapping (:

## 1. Set the Amount

Choose how much you want to swap. The amount can be entered in dollars or the native token amount. A small network fee (required by the blockchain) will be added to the total amount.

## 2. Choose your Tokens

Search and select the tokens you would like to swap. Kryptik will automatically filter valid pairs.

## 3. Approve

Make sure everything looks right and swap! It may take up to ten minutes for your transaction to be confirmed.
