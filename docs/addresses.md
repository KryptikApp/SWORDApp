Instead of an arbitrary handle like _jack.dorsey_ that's managed by a company, your address is created and managed by you. Any action you perform on a blockchain, is tied to your address.

Anyone who knows your public address can see your transaction history and what assets you have inside of your wallet. They can also send things to your wallet without your permission, similar to how anyone with your email address can send you emails. Your address can look different depending on which network you are using. But with Kryptik, each address maps to the same wallet. To view your address, visit the [receive page](https://www.kryptik.app/wallet/receive). This page allows anyone to scan a quick code and easily send assets to your wallet.
